Dear Department,

I am really interest in your offer for 3 main reasons:
1. I love challenges. In every job I have been hired there was always a challenge! In the last years I changed place of work constantly to search a job able to satisfy my curiosity. I am not able to stop to work until the goal is reached. 

2. Data analysis. In all my last jobs the data analysis was a key part of the work. I spend my all day using R to analyse data for our customer. Iâ€™m a also a certified teacher of Data and Software Carpetry Foundation. I taught 2 courses on data analysis and data manipulation: one in Turin and one in Cambridge, and 2 more are on the way.

3. Change of point of view. Until now all my jobs have been in the Academia. Actually, I am working as Research data technician, I have more contact with the customers and I discover that I love to with them, helping people to achieve their goals. I like to switch between Academia to private sector in order to produce high-quality products and render the customers happy.

Please see my CV for additional information on my experience.
I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,
Marco Chiapello
